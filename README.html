<p class="p1"><span class="s1"># Flight Landing Manager</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Flight Landing Manager is a Java program that simulates the takeoff and landing of flights. It utilizes multi-threading and synchronization mechanisms to manage the current capacity of flights at an airport.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">## Functionality</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Flight Landing Manager consists of the following classes:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- `FlightLandingManager`: Manages the current capacity of flights at the airport. It provides methods for takeoff and landing, which increment and decrement the current capacity, respectively.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- `TakeoffRunnable`: Represents a thread responsible for initiating takeoff operations. It interacts with the `FlightLandingManager` to increment the current capacity. The thread sleeps for 1 second between each takeoff operation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- `LandingRunnable`: Represents a thread responsible for initiating landing operations. It interacts with the `FlightLandingManager` to decrement the current capacity. The thread sleeps for 1 second between each landing operation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- `Main`: Contains the main method to start the program. It creates instances of `FlightLandingManager`, `TakeoffRunnable`, and `LandingRunnable`, and starts the corresponding threads. After a certain duration, the program interrupts the threads and stops the takeoff and landing operations.</span></p>
